# Hate-Speech-Detection
Hate Speech Detection Using Java (NetBeans)
This project is a Hate Speech Detection System developed in Java using NetBeans IDE. It uses basic text classification techniques and Java-based logic to identify hate speech and offensive language in user input.

The goal is to build a lightweight, desktop-based application that can analyze text for harmful or abusive content, helping to promote safer and respectful digital communication.

Project Overview
🎯 Objective:
To design and implement a Java-based application that detects hate speech, offensive language, or neutral content by applying basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and keyword-based classification.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java SE (Standard Edition)

NetBeans IDE (Recommended version: 8.2 or later)

Swing GUI – for the front-end interface

Java I/O – for reading input data and model files (optional)

Custom Logic / Keyword Matching / Scoring – for text classification

🧩 Features
✅ GUI-based interface for inputting text

🧠 Keyword-based hate speech detection logic

🧹 Basic text preprocessing (case normalization, stop word removal, etc.)

📊 Label classification: Hate, Offensive, or Neutral

💾 Optional: File input to check bulk data (CSV or .txt)

🔄 Reset and Clear functionality in the GUI

🖥️ Application Modules
1. Main GUI (Java Swing)
A user-friendly interface to input text.

Buttons to "Check", "Clear", and "Exit".

Label showing the classification result.

2. Preprocessing Module
Converts text to lowercase

Removes special characters and stop words (if implemented)

Splits into tokens

3. Detection Logic
Compares input tokens with predefined hate/offensive word lists

Calculates a score or match count

Classifies based on threshold logic:

High hate word score → Hate Speech

Moderate offensive score → Offensive Language

Otherwise → Neutral


if (hateWordCount > 3) {
    resultLabel.setText("Hate Speech Detected");
} else if (offensiveWordCount > 2) {
    resultLabel.setText("Offensive Language Detected");
} else {
    resultLabel.setText("Neutral Content");
}



🧾 How to Run the Project
✅ Requirements:
NetBeans IDE 8.2+

JDK 1.8 or later


📈 Future Enhancements
Integrate with online APIs (e.g., Twitter comment analysis)

Implement machine learning models in Java (Weka, DL4J)

Add a database (MySQL/SQLite) to store user inputs and predictions

Support multilingual hate speech detection

Export analysis report to Excel or PDF
